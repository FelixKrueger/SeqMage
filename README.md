# SeqMage

The SeqMage is supposed to allow the retrieval of arbitrary sequences from any genome at Ensembl. It will try to work out the genomic coordinates from any kind of input file (e.g. bedfiles, SeqMonk reports etc), and get the sequences of interest without the need to download the entire genome file(s).
